# Upbase-Test-App
A Test News Web App Using React JS

I am building this app using react js.
A couple of other third party libraries are also used.

* React Router
* Axios
* Read More React

Every other thing is just a matter of making everything work.

I employ the brute force technique in solving problems then later re-organise.
